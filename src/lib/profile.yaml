    - Hi I'm Zhao Wu, a prospective [NUS College (NUSC)](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/about-us/)
      undergraduate majoring in [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/).
    - I'm a conscientiously driven individual ([INFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality)),
      with an extensive track-record in leadership, project management, and event planning.
    - Before moving on to my next exciting chapter, I graduated as the Gold Medalist
      from [SP's Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA - S30)](https://www.sp.edu.sg/soc/courses/full-time-diplomas/applied-AI-and-analytics/overview).
      This journey fueled my passion for technology and artificial intelligence, propelling
      me one step closer to my career aspiration of an AI Engineer, building applications
      that empower people through AI.
    - Outside the tech realm, I find solace in the outdoors. Whether it's [cycling,
      jogging, hiking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67402211), or my newfound love
      for [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170027850-zhao-wu-wong), I relish
      every opportunity to explore and unwind. Also, I enjoy [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/kiritowu)
